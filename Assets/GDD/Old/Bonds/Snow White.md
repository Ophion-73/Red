Snow White Upgrades: This will give you increased attack speed from weapon upgrades and increased movement speed.
Snow White Status Effect: Once obtained, you will gain the Poison effect, which will normally deal 10% of the enemy's maximum health, ideal for bosses. You will gain stacks with each hit, for a total of 3 stacks. Once all 3 stacks are completed, the enemy will be afflicted with the Sleep debuff. While this debuff is in place, the next melee attack that hits the enemy will deal 30% extra damage (Sleep only lasts a few seconds, approximately 1.5 seconds, and is immediately removed upon receiving a hit from the player; status effects do not count). This Sleep debuff has a 20-second cooldown per enemy, as it cannot be activated continuously, but the poison will remain active. If the player applies poison to an enemy, but the enemy does not attack again to gain more stacks or restart the poison, the player will have 5 seconds to hit again and reset the effect to 0, even if it has 2 or 3 charges.
If the player applies the Sleep debuff to the enemy but does not hit them, the cooldown for the corresponding enemy will be reduced by half.
