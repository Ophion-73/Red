FADE FROM BLACK TO:

[MENU SCREEN]

1. INT. MYSTERY WORKSHOP - DAY

We see a closed book on top of a table, camera zooms in to the book, god-rays painting its surroundings, items decorate the table, sounds of birds and forests decorate the book, the PLAYER clicks and the book faintly reveals the beginning.

DISSOLVE TO:

2. INT. RED'S ROOM - WARM WINTER DAY


RED sleeps soundly on her bed, it is an early morning, and light is coming from the windows. She hears MOTHER calling from downstairs.

MOTHER (O.S.)
Red, it is almost the afternoon! I have prepared breakfast for you!

RED keeps breathing.
[PLAYER gets limited control.]

ON-SCREEN PROMPT (soft fade-in, bottom center)
Press **TBD** to get up

RED shifts in bed, the PLAYER does not see her face, she grabs her iconic red hood, hanging near her bed and puts it on, now showing us her covered face for the mystery character reveal.

ON-SCREEN PROMPT
Press **TBD**/**TBD** to walk.

[PLAYER can now move side to side.]

RED approaches the open bedroom door leading downstairs. Glowing interacting icon appears.

ON-SCREEN PROMPT
Press **TBD** to go downstairs.

[PLAYER INPUT: TBD near stairs → Triggers DIALOGUE cutscene.]

CUT TO:

3. INT. COTTAGE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

[RED'S ROOM is now locked, no need to go back.]

The kitchen implies fresh bread aroma while MOTHER stands near the oven, cooking. It is an inviting home. All the house can be seen from this perspective, living room, dining table and all. MOTHER doesn't show her face, she seems in a rush.

MOTHER
Good morning, darling. Have something to eat before you leave, grandmother is still sick and out of medicine. I can't come with you this time, but please care to take the basket on your own, you know the path well by now. I added some of granny's favorite sweets inside, along with the doctor's recommendations.

RED nods silently.

The BASKET is on the dining table.

[PLAYER INPUT: Walk to the table, TBD to interact and grab BASKET. The BASKET is not really saved anywhere.]

ON-SCREEN PROMPT
You picked the basket.

RED walks towards the main door.

MOTHER
And please my dear, be wary of strangers on your way, don't stray!

[PLAYER INPUT: TBD to interact with door → Player leaves the house.]

CUT TO:

4. EXT. COTTAGE EXTERIOR / WOOD'S PATH

RED walks towards the beginning of the forest path, BASKET in hand, the forest is slightly snowy.

5. THE CURSED WOODS

As RED walks through, trees pass in the foreground as she learns to travel through the woods. She finds herself with several obstacles in her way, a fallen tree blocks her path. 

ON-SCREEN PROMPT
Press TBD to jump over the obstacle.

[PLAYER INPUT: TBD to jump → Player jumps over the obstacle.]

While RED skips and jumps obstacles, shadows cross the foreground of a creature leaping and jumping by. 

The WOLF is lurking nearby, stalking RED through the plants and trees.

The PLAYER moves forward for a bit, jumping obstacles as the WOLF jumps in the foreground and the background, until RED stops. The **CAMERA** pans to the right more, revealing the WOLF, standing above another fallen tree trunk, that rises above enough for RED to walk under, smirking with a hungry face.

WOLF
Little Red Riding Hood, what are you doing here, when the woods are so big and you are so small?

The WOLF breathes faster, beckoning.

RED
_(No response)_
...

The **CAMERA** moves back to RED as she keeps walking forward, running under the fallen tree.

The **CAMERA** pans back again to the WOLF, now with an angry expression. 

WOLF
Hey, do not ignore me child! Don't be rude!

[PLAYER ACTION CHOICE: OPTION 1 → The player goes back to the WOLF.]

WOLF
Ha! Your mom must've taught you to listen? Regardless, I do not wish to stay for a pesky brat such as yourself! Go do whatever errands you were taking care of...

[PLAYER ACTION CHOICE: OPTION 2 → The player keeps walking.]


WOLF jumps back as the camera pans back to RED. 

RED walks for a couple rooms, each two rooms, the ambiance starts to get darker and snowier. Apparently the forest begins to loop.

The PLAYER keeps going until the night arrives.

The NARRATOR makes an appearance, with a raspy but cocky voice he answers, triggering a short CUTSCENE. RED stops in her tracks.

NARRATOR
Little Red Riding Hood seems to be confused. For she was certain the path was the right one, but as she keeps going, the forest doesn't quite look the same to her... Strange indeed.

RED keeps moving forwards, the forest still looping for a while, silence except night creatures can only be heard, until a strong warm light illuminates the far right of a room.

[THE PLAYER CAN KEEP MOVING FORWARD AT THIS POINT IN TIME WHILE THE NARRATOR SPEAKS.]

NARRATOR
Red finds this part of the forest to be somehow familiar, but she can't really tell, for the woods are very dark.

RED reaches a cottage in the middle of the woods, paw markings on a half-opened door.

[THE CURSED WOODS are now locked, no need to go back.]

NARRATOR
With fear crawling through her body, Red finds no other choice but to go inside grandmother's house.

The PLAYER walks to the house.

[PLAYER INPUT: Walk to the door, TBD to interact.]

CUT TO:

6. INT. GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE

The PLAYER walks through a long hallway. 

NARRATOR
The hallway is as ominous as ever, never has it felt less inviting than it is at this very moment.

Until they reach a scratched door. 

Inside, to the right, is the body of RED's grandmother, covered only by the struggle of an ugly-patterned curtain, it is not seen by RED. To the wall next to the door, lays the lumberjack, dead, due to heavy wounds inflicted by WOLF. And in the middle of the room is the WOLF, still breathing but hurt by the AXE, laying in front of the lumberjack. 

The WOLF wakes up, getting its strength ready to attack, and RED runs towards the AXE and grabs it, as the WOLF prepares its jaws.

IN SLOW-MOTION

[PLAYER INPUT: TBD to interact → Grab the AXE.]

[PLAYER INPUT: TBD to attack → Kill the wolf.]

A cutscene plays, the view goes black, a sound of a hurt wolf plays, with a thud accompanying it. 

FADE TO:

7. EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE

RED walks out of the house, her red clothes look redder than before, she is dragging the AXE behind her, as it is too big for her to carry, barely her own size.

The NARRATOR's voice is nowhere to be heard, but RED sees a cloaked figure standing next to the house, the presence inviting.

It appears to be an old woman, willing to help. This woman is the WITCH.

[PLAYER gets no control. This is a CUTSCENE.]

WITCH
Child, come closer.

RED walks towards this woman.

WITCH
You were not meant to witness such tragedy, of that I am sure.

The WITCH pauses.

WITCH
I can help you find a way to a happier ending, if you help me in return.

She uncovers her hooded figure, revealing an old but beautiful woman.

WITCH
Something was taken from me as well, perhaps more important than a part of your family.

She pauses once again.

WITCH
My power is not as strong as it has been for a while, but I could help you, if you can bring me back what was taken. For I am old and brittle to do it myself, and you are young and capable, are you not?

She smiles, RED, for the first time, reacts with some nods.

WITCH
Wonderful! Be a good girl and stay there, I will not take long.

The WITCH enters the house, the lights inside fade, leaving RED in complete darkness, and she passes out.

FADE TO:

8. EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE - MORNING

The WITCH stands next to RED, who apparently lay her on top of a carpet, the AXE is next to her. The house looks normal again.

WITCH
Good morning darling. 

RED sits up slowly staring up at the WITCH.

WITCH
(mischiveously)
It is not what I expected, but the deed is done. Go inside.

[PLAYER input: Walk, interact with the door, and go inside.]

CUT TO:

9. INT. GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE

RED walks the hallway again, it is not messy at all. 
As she enters the room, she sees the WOLF on the floor, slowly waking up, this is now GRANDMA.

GRANDMA
Red?

She stands up, slowly freaking out.

GRANDMA
Red, what is happening to me?

GRANDMA becomes angry.

GRANDMA
What has SHE done to me?

CUT TO:

10. EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE

[BLACK SCREEN]

WITCH
It was an honest mistake.

The screen fades to show all three outside the house.

GRANDMA
How dare you use these bodies for your dark magic?

WITCH
Dear, your granddaughter and I simply made a deal. No harm on it. I even fixed your house and that lumberjack to make it up for this tiny mistake.

GRANDMA
TINY? YOU LITTLE-

RED grabs GRANDMA's leg, looking up at her, and she sighs.

GRANDMA
Forgive me, child, I do not wish for you to see us... me... like this.

The witch cackles devilishly.

WITCH
As long as you are able to help me recover what I lost, I assure you, things will be back to how they were and even better.

GRANDMA
And how exactly do you suppose we do that?

WITCH
Well, it won't be simple, but I can help you on the way, no mistakes this time, I promise.

GRANDMA
To trust a witch, that is indeed funny. And to have the child harmed? How dare you.

WITCH
It is up to you, if you want your body as it was. I will try my best to ensure the least amount of harm befalls you. If you wish to learn. Follow me.

The WITCH walks to the left of the screen, the woods seem different now as well.

The PLAYER rides the wolf, and follows behind the WITCH, to the left room, where the **COMBAT TUTORIAL** will take place.
