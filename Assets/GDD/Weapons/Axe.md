Ground Attacks
Left/Right: The axe will attack horizontally, creating the effect of felling a tree. The enemy's knockback will cause a very slight backward movement, allowing the player to follow up with the next attack. This damage will be medium.
Down: The axe's swing will be a light attack with the knauf. This hit will deal low damage, causing the enemy's knockback to fall.
Up: The axe will strike an uppercut with the edge, knocking the enemy upward and dealing significant damage.

Air Attacks
Left/Right: The axe will attack horizontally, similar to a ground attack, but this time it will double-hit in the air. The player will be slightly knocked back in the direction of the enemy, and the knockback will be in the opposite direction from where the enemy was hit. Up: The axe will embed itself in the enemy, grabbing them and throwing them to the ground. This will deal damage. High and the enemy will fall to the ground.
Down: The axe will attack in a whirlwind, dealing multiple hits of damage to enemies in the air. Low damage.
