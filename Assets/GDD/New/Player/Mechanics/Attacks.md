The player will be able to use many attacks but will mainly be divided into red and grandma attacks.

red attacks will be used with attach button 1(input manager)  and will do a different attack depending on the directional input. both left and write directional input will do the same attack but to each side respectively. pressing attack button 1 without any directional input will result in a "jab combo". air attacks will result in new attacks as well.

grandma attacks will behave exactly the same but with attack button 2 and will probably use a cooldown system and will not have a jab system nor air specific attacks  probably tbd.

(maybe there will  be an extra attack with attack button 3 that will do always the same regardless of air, and probably have a cooldown. this attack hill have the placholder name of "cast")
